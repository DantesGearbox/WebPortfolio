                    <p class="lead">Game rules</p> 
                    <p> This game was made for a university course by me and a team. The assignment was to design a (non-digital) sport. No definition of 'sport' was given and therefore part of the assignment was to think about what consitutes a sport and what is simply a game. </p>
                    <p>We ended up making a freesbee-golfing-like game with a bottle cap instead of a freesbee. The objective of the game is to get the cap to the end of the playing field. The team that reaches the end of the playing field with the fewest amount of points wins. The player currently carrying the bottle cap cannot move. The player who has to catch the bottle cap decides how far away he wants to move. Players can only move along their own line. You get one point for each time you move. You get one extra point if you drop the cap. You need to flick the cap with two fingers in one hand. No Throwing allowed. Two players on each team. Minimum of two teams. Only one team plays at a time. A game consists of minimum 2 rounds. 1 round takes around 5 minutes. The field is 15 meters long and widens along the edge from 2 meters to 4 meters.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">Reflections</p>
                    <p>The sport is completely skill based, there are no random elements. This means that the game is not going to create much tension, if the two teams have very different skill levels. Once a team is far ahead, there is little the other team can do to catch up to them. This also means that the the game gives a clear feeling of who is the best team. This is a sport about achieving superiority. Spectator enjoyment may be had in the game when players are forced to go for risky throws to catch up. Since the goal of the game is to make it to the end of the playing field in as few flicks as possible there is an incentive to go for longer flicks between the players. This introduces a natural element of risk and rewards. E.G. go for longer flicks and potentially get penalized for it (not catching the cap). </p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">Background</p>
                    <p>This game was developed as an exercise in developing sports that contain props. We very quickly decided that we wanted an easily accesible prop, and so we settled on the cap of a drinking yogurt. As kids, some of us had used similar caps as "freesbees" in the schoolyard and therefore knew of the way it was possible "flick" such a cap to get fling it surprisingly far. The cap; much like a freesbee, has an interesting flight-path and therefore has a quite high skill-ceiling for learning to "throw" it.</p>
